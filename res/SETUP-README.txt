To run the program from the JAR file open a command-prompt/terminal and navigate to the res folder.In order to run the text-based interface, type java -jar FINAL_STOCK_PROGRAM.jar -text andpress ENTER. When wanting to use the graphical user interface, the user should instead typejava -jar FINAL_STOCK_PROGRAM.jar. The different commands should open up the desired type ofprogram. Moreover, this program supports all stocks provided by the tickerSymbols.csv database.Moreover, ten of the most common stocks are already in the folder, that the user can use if thereis no internet. This program can run without the internet, the only restriction of this is thatwhen the program runs, the dates that can be accounted for must be already in the file. The filewill not actively update. Although, this is not that much of a restriction, as all the data prioris still available. Lastly, be sure that the ticker symbol csv file is in the program when runningit, as this supporting file is very important for checking if the ticker symbol is valid. Whendownloading this, it should already be there, but ensure it is.
