This Java program supports several key features that allow the user to use this stock management
program. This program uses real-time data for specific companies so that the user can track the
stockâ€™s movement over periods. When running the program, a list of options comes up for the user.
When the user enters a specific number, corresponding to an option, it then asks for a series of
questions to finally produce the wanted output. The first feature of this program is that it
calculates the gain or loss of a stock over a specified period. After entering this choice, the
program asks for the ticker symbol, the start, and the end date. From this, the program will
calculate this value and print it out. The next feature is to examine the x-day moving average of
a stock for a specified date and value of x. Therefore, when this value is selected, the program
will ask for the stock ticker symbol again, the start date, and the number of desired days for
calculation. Below, it will print the average from the specified inputs. For the last calculation
feature, the program will determine x-day crossovers for a specified stock over a date range and
value of x. When selecting this, the program will again ask for the stock ticker symbol, the start
date, the end date, and the specific value for the number of days. It will print outbbelow every
single date from the specified range where a crossover occurred. If there are no crossovers in the
specified range, then nothing will show up. For these stats, appropriate messages come up for
instance if the stock ticker symbol is not recognized or the dates can not be used to calculate
the number. If something is inputted incorrectly, then it also indicates within the program,
to try again. To access this specific data, once the correct symbol is typed in, that file is
downloaded, and therefore the program can calculate the statistics with the most recent data.
The next few features utilize the use of portfolios, with buying and selling stocks. To begin
the use of the next features, the program permits the user to create one or more portfolios.
The user can select the option to create a new portfolio and enter a name. More than one portfolio
can be created, which can be accessed at any time as well.  Moreover, it is important to note that
before any of the following features are used, at least one portfolio has to be created, otherwise
a message will come up prompting the user to make a portfolio. With this portfolio, the user can
buy or sell stocks. When the user presses one of these options, it will prompt the user for the
portfolio name, the ticker symbol, the quantity, and the date. Therefore, the program can keep
track of how many the user is buying and selling on that specific date in that specific portfolio.
Meanwhile, this is all kept track in another feature that gets the composition of the specific
portfolio. When entering this option, it asks for the portfolio's name and the desired date.
With this the programs lists out a lists of stocks that the portfolio contains, as well as the
number of shares, for keeping track of buying and selling. Another feature is to display the
distribution of value of that portfolio on that specficic date. Now when that optionnis chosen,
it will ask for the name of the portfolio and the date again, in which it will print out the stocks
in that portfolio, with the value of each individual stock. The sum of this should equal the value.
Moreover, another feature is saving the portfolio to an outside file. It will ask
the user to enter the portfolio name and the file name, and it will indicate that the portfolio was
saved as the file name inputted. This file should now be found on that individuals laptop. In order
to retrieve it, just select the option and enter the portfolio name, and since they are associated,
the program will indicate that it has been retrieved. There are now two more features. The next
future allows the user to rebalance the portfolio. It wll ask for a series of questions, that asks
what the stock is and what to rebalance the portfolio to. Morevoer, the decimals have to equal 1,
and once this is rebalanced, obtaining the portfolio distribution will confirm the right answer.
The user can also prompt the program to graph a portfolio's performance over time. It will ask for
the name, the starting and ending date. The scale would be based on the period of time and how much
value is in that portfolio, but with all of that information it will be graphed with astericks to
show the change in value. These are all the features regarding the text-based interface. This time
around, more has been added with a GUI (graphical user interface). In the terminal, the user can
prompt for the GUI to run instead, and now there is an interactive program that the user can use.
In this program, the user can create a portfolio, buy and sell stocks, save and load portfolios,
and obtain the value or composition of a specific portfolio. The GUI utilizes a series of screens
and buttons to help navigate across the different options of what was listed above. Overall, this
highlights the main features of this program and its capabilites. It is clear that there are a lot
of features of this program that can calculate relevant statistics and allow a user-interaction
program.
